**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
This is not related to the problem but can improve the user experience while studying and understanding the course in the Lesson section. As of now users just go directly or even skip the course without knowing whether they understand the content of the course

**Describe the solution you'd like**
It would be great if we added quiz features. Users will be tested to what extent they have understood the video lessons given, and if they pass, they will get EXP and can continue on the next video lesson. If they do not pass, the user must repeat the quiz to be able to continue learning.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
If it difficult to implement, We can make it like the Quiz in the Campaign.

**Additional context**
For the desired solution it will be great if we can implement something like this. We can accumulate EXP from each lesson, this will also make a simple design
